            My story of getting the loan with bad credit in Delaware
          </p>
          <p class="section_2_text">
            While its high borrowing rates are on its budget, Amal will have
            difficulty renegotiating them. This housewife’s budget was sifted
            through.
          </p>
          <p class="section_2_text">
            A house with a garden in Toulouse, large enough to allow the rental
            of the floor and with a ground floor adaptable to his disability,
            scalable. The Amal project (photo below), implemented in 2010, has
            since become a source of concern for this mother. In the meantime
            divorced, she ensures alone the repayment of the two loans,
            subscribed at the rate of 4,05%. It would, of course, be possible to
            find cheaper today, but his banker wants to know nothing. And yet,
            there is much to say about the editing recommended at the time.
          </p>
          <p class="section_2_text">
            Thus, only her ex-husband had insured for the sole risk of death and
            disability. In case of incapacity of work of gentleman, the couple
            would have been an unfortunate posture. And, while the divorce would
            require to separate the loans, putting them in the name of Madam,
            the bank does not push the operation. That’s not all: to get a PTZ,
            it was a double credit line that was then set up. “But this
            interweaving makes it impossible to modulate downward deadlines,”
            laments Laurent Perrot, agency director at You finance. It is this
            type of option which, if Amal’s expenses were to increase after a
            deterioration in her state of health, would be more than useful.
          </p>
          <p class="section_2_text">
            Suffice to say that it would be better to put all the editing back
            in the air. After all, its revenues from, among other things, rents
            on the floor, divided into student rooms, cover the maturities of
            the related credit. The problem is that banks are now reluctant to
            consider such leases from renting part of their principal residence.
            As for Amal’s activity income, they are too limited.
          </p>
          <p class="section_2_text">
            As a result, his living income, even estimated at nearly 1,000 euros
            per month, is insufficient. “It should have 650 euros per adult,
            plus 400 euros per child, or 1,450 euros in total,” details Laurent
            Perrot. In short, the solution would be, as Amal seeks to do, to
            find a stable job, with more income. The challenge will then be to
            see an insurer, before restructuring its credits over a 25-year term
            with a new institution. Unless his banker ends up having some
            remorse, and by consenting to make a gesture.…

            The Common Administrative Procedure Law of Public Administrations
            (LPAC)

          <p class="section_4_text">
            The law 39/2015, of October 1, of Common Administrative Procedure of
            the Public Administrations (LPAC), arrives at the normative essence
            of our legal system before the insufficiency of the existent
            normative frame: the technological advances made necessary reform of
            the administrative procedure and the administration.
          </p>
          <p class="section_4_text">
            Although the LPAC is a newborn to the Spanish regulatory world, the
            truth is that I came with the baggage of the old Law 30/92: now the
            regulation of the administrative procedure is divided into norms
            that govern the external relations of the Administrations- Law 39 /
            2015, and the legal regime of Public Administrations-Law 40/2015.
          </p>
          <p class="section_4_text">
            Among the innovations that the LPAC brings us, the adaptation of the
            Administration to a technological world stands out. Our Public
            Administration could not and should not, be it that of the State,
            Autonomous Communities, or Local Entities closers such as City
            Councils or Town Councils, to afford not to be at the technological
            forefront.
          </p>
          <p class="section_4_text">
            The LPAC says that “the development of information and communication
            technologies has also profoundly affected the form and content of
            the Administration’s relations with citizens and companies.”
